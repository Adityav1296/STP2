## Solve
**Flag:** `nite{1'v3_b33n_w41t1ng_f0r_y0u_4t_cape_no._7}`

- In the second image, the pole clearly shows a plate with certain numbers and alphabets on it. That was the most important clue in solving this challenge.
- Searching online, I found these two sites that contained information on how to read through those plates.
   1. (Taiwan Power Company Grid)[https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Taiwan_Power_Company_grid]
   2. (Plonk It : Taiwan)[https://www.plonkit.net/taiwan]
- Going through them, I identified the region in the pic. It turned out to be `Puzi City` in `Taiwan`. Then I roamed around using google street view and found the correct area which gave me the flag.
